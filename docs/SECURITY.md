- **Scanned items and drafts:** Stored locally on the device in the app database. Retained until you delete items/drafts in the app, clear app storage, or uninstall the app.
- **On-device analysis:** Camera frames are processed locally and discarded immediately after analysis.
- **Cloud classification (optional):** If enabled, cropped object images are sent for classification, processed transiently, and discarded after processing. No long-term storage linked to your identity.
- **User controls:** You can delete scans and drafts, disable cloud classification, and clear app storage at any time to control retention.
