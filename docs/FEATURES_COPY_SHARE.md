# Copy + Share Listing Package

Scanium provides one-tap copy and share actions from Draft Review without any automation or third-party APIs.

## Copy actions
- **Copy title**: copies the current draft title.
- **Copy description**: copies the draft description.
- **Copy all**: copies a structured, multi-section listing package with title, price, condition, category, description, and photo count.

The copy output is generated by a portable formatter in shared models to ensure consistent ordering and text across platforms.

## Share action
- Uses the Android system sharesheet.
- Shares text plus up to 6 images, ordered with the primary image first.
- If no photos are available, shares text only and shows a warning.

## Safety note
No automatic posting, autofill, or web automation is performed. All copy/share actions are user initiated and Play Store compliant.
