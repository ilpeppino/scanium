# Scanium Icon Assets

This document explains the icon asset structure and the roles of different icon designs in the
Scanium app.

## Icon Designs

The project contains **two distinct icon designs**:

### 1. Lightning Bolt Design (Current Launcher Icon)

- **Shape**: Geometric/angular "S" formed by three parallelograms, resembling a lightning bolt or
  sigma symbol
- **Location**: `assets/final/bitmaps/`, `assets/exports/`
- **Used for**:
    - Android launcher icon (adaptive + legacy)
    - Notification icons
    - Play Store icon

### 2. Curved "S" Design (Legacy/UI)

- **Shape**: Smooth, rounded "S" letter with curved strokes
- **Location**: `branding/logo/`, `assets/design/`, `assets/final/vectors/`
- **Used for**:
    - Splash screen (`ic_splash.xml`)
    - In-app branding (`scanium_logo.png`, `scanium_icon.png`)
    - Design source files

## Android App Icon Structure

### Adaptive Icons (Android 8.0+)

Located in `androidApp/src/main/res/`:

```
mipmap-anydpi-v26/
├── ic_launcher.xml          # Adaptive icon definition
└── ic_launcher_round.xml    # Round adaptive icon

drawable/
├── ic_launcher_foreground_lightning.xml   # Lightning bolt foreground (ACTIVE)
├── ic_launcher_monochrome_lightning.xml   # Lightning bolt monochrome (ACTIVE)
├── ic_launcher_foreground.xml             # Curved S foreground (DEPRECATED)
└── ic_launcher_monochrome.xml             # Curved S monochrome (DEPRECATED)

values/
└── colors.xml               # Contains ic_launcher_background (#1F4BFF)
```

### Legacy Launcher Icons (Android 7.x)

PNG icons for devices that don't support adaptive icons:

```
mipmap-mdpi/    (48x48)   └── ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png
mipmap-hdpi/    (72x72)   └── ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png
mipmap-xhdpi/   (96x96)   └── ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png
mipmap-xxhdpi/  (144x144) └── ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png
mipmap-xxxhdpi/ (192x192) └── ic_launcher.png, ic_launcher_round.png
```

## Asset Generation

### Lightning Bolt PNGs

Source: Exported from design tool (Figma/Sketch)
Location: `assets/final/bitmaps/icon_*.png`

To update launcher icons:

1. Export new PNGs from design tool at required sizes
2. Copy to appropriate mipmap folders
3. Update vector drawables if needed

### Curved "S" Assets

Generated by: `branding/generate_assets.py`
Source SVG: `branding/logo/scanium-icon-mark.svg`

To regenerate curved "S" assets:

```bash
cd branding
python generate_assets.py
```

## Why Two Designs Exist

The curved "S" design was the original icon. The lightning bolt design was created as an evolution
representing speed and energy. The launcher icon and splash screen now use the lightning bolt design
while some in-app branding elements retain the curved "S" for visual continuity during transition.

## Future Considerations

- The curved "S" drawables (`ic_launcher_foreground.xml`, `ic_launcher_monochrome.xml`) are marked
  as deprecated and can be removed if no longer needed.
