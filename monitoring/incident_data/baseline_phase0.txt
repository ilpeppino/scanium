MIMIR SERIES INDEX:
Series EXIST with labels:
- up{job="scanium-backend",instance="scanium-backend",source="scanium-backend"}
- up{job="alloy",instance="scanium-alloy",source="pipeline"}
- up{job="loki",instance="scanium-loki",source="pipeline"}
- up{job="mimir",instance="scanium-mimir",source="pipeline"}
- up{job="tempo",instance="scanium-tempo",source="pipeline"}

DIAGNOSIS:
✓ Series exist in Mimir label index
✗ Queries return empty results
→ CONFIRMS: Querier NOT reading from ingesters

LOKI:
- Labels endpoint returns incomplete response (no data array)
- Alloy is UNHEALTHY - likely cause of Loki ingestion failure

ROOT CAUSE HYPOTHESIS:
1. Mimir: Querier not configured to query ingesters for recent data
2. Loki: Alloy unhealthy preventing log ingestion
