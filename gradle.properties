# Java Toolchain Configuration
# This project requires Java 17. Gradle will automatically find a compatible JDK
# on your system using the jvmToolchain(17) configuration in build.gradle.kts
#
# IMPORTANT: If build fails with Java version errors:
# 1. Install Java 17: https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17
# 2. Gradle will auto-detect it, no configuration needed
#
# Note: org.gradle.java.home is intentionally not set to keep the project portable
# across different machines and operating systems
